## Use Case
This plugin extends `site:list` to allow users to execute commands on each site that is listed.

It will take arguments for environment `--env=`, framework `--frame=`, tags `--tags=` and organizations `--org=`.

You can also specify a command `--command=` to apply to all of the sites targeted.

Ex. `terminus can --frame='wordpress' --env='dev' --command='terminus [site] wp plugin update --all && terminus [site] wp theme update themename'`.

In the command, you have tokens available to use as placeholders for each sites data.
* `[site]` will produce site.env; Ex. `yoursite.live`
* `[name]` will produce the sites name; Ex. `yoursite`
* `[env]` will produce the environment selected; Ex. `live`
